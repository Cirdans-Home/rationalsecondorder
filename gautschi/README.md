# GAUTSCHI

This folder contains the implementation of the one-step formulation of the Gautschi-type integrator.
To make it work, you will need to add to the path the routines for the poles from the 'rationalapprox'
folder.

The two example files are those related to the examples of the paper, the synthetic one and the one based on the solution of the wave equation with finite elements.
