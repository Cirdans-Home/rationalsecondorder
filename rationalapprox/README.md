# Rational Approximation

This folder contains the codes related to the different rational 
approximations of the sinc function and the generation of different 
types of poles.

- `genlagpol.m` Laguerre based poles,
- `genlagpolsym.m` Doubling of the Laguerre based poles,
- `genlagexppol.m` Laguerre based poles from the exponential expansion,
- `genlappoles.m` Poles obtained from the inversion of the Laplace transform with the optimization parabolic contour on the spectra interval. It requires the spectral interval.
- `genspougepoles.m` poles obtained from the Spouge approximation of the Gamma(1+x) function,
